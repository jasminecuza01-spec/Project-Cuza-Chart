      while affordable housing remains out of reach.

      Homelessness in New York City is not static — it is movement. Every day, thousands of people enter
      shelters, leave shelters, and return again. Mothers pushing strollers in intake lines, young men
      sleeping in shared rooms miles away from their families, and children who have never known a stable
      bedroom all appear in these numbers. The city's shelter system is often portrayed as a temporary
      safety net. The data shows something different and what it shows is  a revolving door.
    </p>

    <p>
      Across the past five years, the daily census of New Yorkers in shelters has climbed to some of the
      highest levels on record. Women and children consistently make up a large share of the population,
      reflecting how family instability, domestic violence, and rising rents hit many of the population the hardest.
      Men occupy the most beds, but they also cycle in and out the fastest and often after short stays that
      never translate into permanent housing.

    <p>
      This matters now because New York has bet its entire homelessness strategy on shelter capacity, not
      prevention or long term housing. Even as the city expands beds, families are still being displaced.
      A mother with two children can leave the system for a week and return to find no placement close to
      their school. A young father can complete a 90-day program and still face a landlord demanding three
      months' rent, a high credit score, and no past evictions. This is an impossible combination for someone who
      just left a shelter.

    <h2>Who Is the Shelter System Failing Most?</h2>

      This chart shows the average daily number of people in NYC shelters by group — women, children, and men —
      across the past five years.

      The combined numbers of men, women, and children in New York City shelters paint a crisis that is bigger
      than any single population. Over the past five years, the total shelter census has steadily climbed —
      reaching levels that many New Yorkers don't see unless they are living them. The city often treats
      homelessness as a matter of individual failure or personal struggle. The data tells a different story:
      entire families, working-age adults, and school-aged children are moving in and out of the system every day.

    <blockquote>
      "The primary cause of homelessness is not severe mental illness — it's poverty," said Dr. Jonathan Prince,
      a clinical professor of psychology at Hunter College. "It is very easy to slip into homelessness if you lose
      your job, don't have benefits, or face a health problem that eats up your income. Our safety net doesn't catch
      many people, and once you're in the shelter system, it becomes very hard to get out. Homelessness is a trap,
      and the shelter system is a maze of procedures and paperwork that makes it incredibly difficult to escape."
